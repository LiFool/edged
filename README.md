Edged is an experimental graph database, written in Go. It's heavily inspired by the Metaweb / Freebase / Google's graphd (described here - http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807167.1807283&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&type=series&idx=SERIES473&part=series&WantType=Proceedings&title=SIGMOD).

It currently only supports insertion and very basic value queries (look up a 0/1 nodes given a value).
